Today I am going to teach you how to run your own World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King server from start to finish using
Virtualbox and Debian Linux.
My video is not going to be flashy, but I assure you that I am teaching you just about the best way to do this.
There are other guides out there on websites and youtube that recommend you run this in Windows using so-called "repacks" but
as a gamer since 1984, and someone who has ran his own dedicated game servers as far back as the Counterstrike beta, I strongly
disagree with that way of doing it. Don't just take my word for it - the server we are using - Azerothcore (which is free and open source on github) - agrees with me in their FAQ: https://www.azerothcore.org/wiki/faq

Q. Do you support Repacks based on AzerothCore?
A. No. Repacks are NOT supported and we strongly suggest to not use them for several reasons. You can check this tutorial for an easy way of installing AC without using any repack.
There are a lot of guides out there, but so far I've not seen any of them show you how to install the version with bots to make your server come to life, let alone basic server upkeep, bot control,
and additional cool things such as the AI voice addon which has narration for the quest text!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Benefits to running your own WoW server
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Retail World of Warcraft as we all know is a non-stop train - it keeps going and never stops. Private servers, on the other hand, are hosted
by fans across the world, but they all seem to eventually go offline for one reason or another. They also mostly beg you for money, or are pay to win, and are
generally for-profit. Azerothcore is completely different. Finally, a group of people decided to collaberate and allow anyone to submit changes and improvements with
their free and open source model! Although you can use this exact source code to run your own server, we will be using a slightly modified version that allows for bot integration.
The official Azerothcore website is here: https://www.azerothcore.org/
All of the other links are below. I am not a programmer and I have no affiliation with any of the tools we will be using today - I am just a gamer, a fan of World of Warcraft, and a strong supporter of freedom and open source software.

I will try not to get too technical in this tutorial. You should be able to get it up and running as quickly as possible. I could explain every little thing that is going on, but this
tutorial would be several hours long. We can run now and learn later! I tend to be more of a gamer than a knob turner! Self-hosting World of Warcraft gives you god-like
powers in terms of customization. Here are just some of the control you have in the game:

-Name your realm, assign GMs (game masters), create accounts (and what expansion that account has unlocked, from vanilla to WotLK), and more!
-Install/uninstall any of the dozens of fan-made modules for Azerothcore, such as transmog NPC, skip DK starting zone, account-wide mounts, and more!
-Allow cross-faction grouping, guilding, communication, and raiding. You can even decide to allow all classes for any race, such as a human druid! It's up to you.
-Change bot behavior, item drop rates, gold, boss health, mob health, mob spawn rates and locations.
-Change and/or disable cooldowns of abilities, debuffs, buffs, and everything else.
-Disable the daze effect (being hit from behind), hearth cooldown, hunter pet happiness, deserter debuff, and everything else! There is almost no limit!
-Keep up to date on future changes of playerbots and Azerothcore or decide to never update and your server will remain static and unchanged! A peaceful, relaxing azeroth that is always available.
-Open the server to remote connections and allow your friends anywhere in the world to connect to you! Or keep it private so only you or those on your home network to connect and play!
-The good feeling that you own your server and it cannot be taken away from you. You own it. Nobody will ask you for money, and Blizzard cannot take your server down. It is really yours.

Why would I want to play with bots?
-Bots make your sever feel alive, even if you're the only human logged into your realm!
-Bots will help you quest, dungeon, and raid. They will heal you, resurrect you,buff you, and even greet you!
-You can decide to have 0 bots, 1 bot, or 1600 bots running around on your realm. It's up to you.
-"Playerbots" are unique in that they are actual, valid accounts generated on your server. They have real inventories, gear, stats, and gold.
Unlike "NPCBots," Playerbots can be inspected, traded with, and commanded on a deeper level. For example, you can spawn a Dwarf priest to give yourself the Fear Ward buff!
-You can immediately change the spec and gear of your bots in your group at any time. You can even summon them to you wherever you are, even in a dungeon, without a warlock!
I have not tried it, but I'm fairly sure you can summon a real warlock to you and have the warlock cast an actual summoning stone, just like the real thing.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why use my guide?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I played World of Warcraft from January 2005 to sometime in 2021, mostly as "Painbow-Mal'Ganis," an Orc Hunter. I want to play
the game as accurately as possible without cheating, but I also want the ability to try interesting things out if I feel like it such as flying to Hyjal (a place you couldn't get to in 3.3.5a),
or give myself quality of life features such as instant log out. I have very high standards when it comes to running software on a computer, and spend hours seeking and self-testing
various methods until I am confident my methods are the most reliable, free, secure, robust, repeatable, responsive, and unobtrusive methods available.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hardware requirements for the server.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Getting started.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can do this even if you know nothing of programming, coding, Linux, operating systems, or anything real complex. You just have to be able to follow my
instructions exactly. I feel everyone - no matter the skill level - deserves to be able to enjoy running their own server.


After installing the Debian GNU/Linux operating system in Virtualbox, we will now connect to it via its IP address using either a windows command prompt or putty.
In windows cmd, type ssh USERNAME@192.168.1.250 (or whatever the USERNAME and IP address is of the Debian OS is)
e.g, ssh nirv@192.168.1.250
#If you don't know the IP address of Debian, log in using the Virtualbox window using the username and password we installed with, then type ip a.
#Once you log in with windows cmd, you should see this prompt.

nirv@azeroth:~$

From this point, let's make a password for the root account.
Root is the "administrator" account. This password can be the same or different from your user you created.

#Change root password
sudo passwd
#don't make the password too large. we'll be typing it frequently

#Now let's log into the root account
su -

Logging into the root account will make your prompt look slightly different than above.

root@azeroth:~#

#Allow logging in SSH as root directly (you can only SSH into user accounts if you do not change this)
sed -ie '0,/#PermitRootLogin prohibit-password/s/#PermitRootLogin prohibit-password/PermitRootLogin yes/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config && service sshd restart

#from now on you can log in to your Linux PC directly as root instead of the username like this:
ssh root@192.168.1.250
(or whatever your IP address is)

#Faster boot
nano /etc/default/grub
GRUB_DEFAULT=1
GRUB_TIMEOUT=0
update-grub


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2025-08-02 - NOTE FOR PROXMOX CONTAINER USERS ONLY
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: If you want to install Azerothcore in a container rather than a Virtual Machine (such as the ones in Proxmox), you must change the following after you git clone azerothcore-wotlk, but before the "install-deps" command.
#assuming you are using a Debian container, open this config.sh file and you will see this at about the 23rd line: # OSDISTRO="ubuntu"
#this will not work until you have ran the git clone command below first, or you won't have config.sh
nano ~/azerothcore-wotlk/conf/dist/config.sh
OSDISTRO="debian"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We will now install required Azerothcore and Playerbots software
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

apt update && apt upgrade -y
apt install git curl unzip sudo tmux -y
git clone https://github.com/mod-playerbots/azerothcore-wotlk.git --branch=Playerbot
cd ~/azerothcore-wotlk/modules
git clone https://github.com/mod-playerbots/mod-playerbots.git --branch=master

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We will now use Azerothcore's script to install required dependencies for our machine
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cd ~/azerothcore-wotlk
./acore.sh install-deps

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We must now build our Azerothcore world binaries by compiling
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
./acore.sh compiler all

#NOTE: Compiling can take anywhere from 4 to 45 minutes, depending on your CPU power.
You can learn more about what compiling is using google. Just know that for our purposes, you only need to compile/build when:
-You update azerothcore using the update command
-You update modules using the updatemods command
-You add a new module
-You remove a module

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modify mysql after compiling is finished
If you don't add the third line disable_log_bin, your hard drive will fill up really fast with huge database logs!!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nano /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf

#COPY AND PASTE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE FILE
bind-address            = 0.0.0.0
mysqlx-bind-address     = 0.0.0.0
disable_log_bin
#END OF PASTE

sudo systemctl restart mysql

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now create the "acore" mysql user.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#SEVERAL PEOPLE FOR SOME REASON HAVE HAD A PROBLEM WITH THIS. I DO NOT KNOW WHY, BUT YOU NEED TO CREATE THIS DATABASE ACCOUNT OR YOUR SERVER WILL NOT START.

sudo mysql -u root

DROP USER IF EXISTS 'acore'@'localhost';
CREATE USER 'acore'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'acore' WITH MAX_QUERIES_PER_HOUR 0 MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_HOUR 0 MAX_UPDATES_PER_HOUR 0;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'acore'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `acore_playerbots` . * TO 'acore'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS `acore_world` DEFAULT CHARACTER SET UTF8MB4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `acore_auth` . * TO 'acore'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
exit;

<press enter>


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We need to download the client data and copy some config files or your server won't work.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cd ~/azerothcore-wotlk
./acore.sh client-data
cp env/dist/etc/authserver.conf.dist env/dist/etc/authserver.conf
cp env/dist/etc/worldserver.conf.dist env/dist/etc/worldserver.conf

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#MANDATORY - STOP THE SERVER

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BEFORE YOU LOG IN, YOU MUST CREATE AN ACCOUNT.
YOU CAN ONLY CREATE WOW ACCOUNTS FROM THE WORLD SESSION TERMINAL
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Creating your first account and giving him GM powers

Start your server again if it isn't up:
start

Create your account from the world session tmux terminal:
wow

#account create <username> <password>

account create nirv banana

#if you want to make your character a GM
account set gmlevel nirv 3 -1

Now is a good time to download the WotLK 3.3.5a client. I advise you extract this 17GB folder to your fastest drive. Download it here:
https://www.chromiecraft.com/en/downloads/

#if you need to change password.
account set password nirv banana2 banana2

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Setting the IP address in your 3.3.5a WoW client so you can connect to the server!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We need to allow the client to connect to our server now by modifying the realmlist.wtf file, located in \Data\enUS\ in your ChromieCraft folder.
#in my case
C:\ChromieCraft_3.3.5a\Data\enUS\realmlist.wtf
set realmlist 192.168.1.250
Open wow.exe, type your username and password for the account you just created and connect!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YOUR SERVER IS NOW OPERATIONAL! THE FOLLOWING IS FOR MORE CONFIGURATION!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Basic Linux commands you'll want to remember for your server:
#modify playerbots config (such as how many bots you want and their behavior/gear)
pb
#modify azerothcore world config (such as whether your server is PvE, PvP, RP-PvP, spawn frequency, human player limit, expansion, vanilla, bc, wotlk, mod visibility distance, 30 second logout wait disable etc)
world
#start and stop server
start
stop
#GM commands, add accounts, delete accounts, ban players, or send server messages to the entire realm etc)
wow
#update your azerothcore server and playerbots module (remember to type build after you update or your server will not be updated)
update
#build azerothcore after updating (you will not lose data doing this)
build
#recompile azerothcore with modules from scratch (also will not lose data. this may help in compiling errors with build)
compile
#update all of your modules in your modules folder (such as auction house bot, transmog module, aoe loot, account-wide mounts etc)
updatemods




-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OPTIONAL - Force your Debian Linux to keep the same IP address
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your Debian OS may change its IP out of no where. If it does, there are multiple ways to keep a static IP on the system. You
can use your router if it allows STATIC IPs via MAC ADDRESS, or you can try the method below.

#Find your current IP
ip a
#Let's assume it's 192.168.1.250. We will now force debian to keep that IP.

#Find the gateway. usually it's 192.168.1.1
apt install net-tools -y
route -n

#Find the network interface. It's the one that says "UP" here when you use this command. usually it's enp0s3 or something. Let's assume that's it.
ip -br -c link show
#With the current IP, the gateway, and the network interface, let's modify the config.
nano /etc/network/interfaces

#Make sure to comment out or delete the two settings below "the primary network interface" "allow-hotplug" and "iface." We will add the
modifications below that so it's static.

#If you are having connection issues, make sure to set both "gateway" and "dns-nameservers" below to YOUR gateway, which may be
different from my 192.168.1.1!

# The primary network interface
#allow-hotplug enp0s3
#iface enp0s3 inet dhcp
auto enp0s3
iface enp0s3 inet static
 address 192.168.1.250
 netmask 255.255.255.0
 gateway 192.168.1.1
 dns-domain azeroth.core
 dns-nameservers 192.168.1.1

CTRL+S to save and then type exit to close putty. We need to type the next command in the Virtualbox Window
sudo systemctl restart networking.service

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#OPTIONAL REMOTE SQL DATABASE CONNECTION (HeidiSQL)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo mysql -u root
#replace the two "nirv" and the "banana" password below with the login/password you would like. This will be entered into your HeidiSQL software in Windows. Connecting this way is visually easier to modify the database for most people.
#This is not necessary unless you want to explore / modify your SQL database in a GUI. Another alternative to this is DBeaver for Linux.
CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS 'nirv'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'banana';GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'nirv'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;
exit;
systemctl restart mysql.service

One final thing to hide the Debian VM to run in the background from now on.
Open Windows Explorer
Navigate to C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox
In the File Explorer address bar, type cmd and press enter. From here, assuming you named your Debian machine in virtualbox "Azeroth" paste the following command here. Match the name to the name of your VM.
From now on when you start the debian PC it will always run headless, or in the background. You can even close Virtualbox itself!
#Note - Debian must be shut down before you run this command. shutdown now to shutdown in Linux
VBoxManage modifyvm "Azeroth" --defaultfrontend headless

Part 3 - Installing modules like account-wide mounts and no hearth cooldown!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
List of Azerothcore modules:
https://www.azerothcore.org/catalogue.html#/
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installing our first module
Module: mod-no-hearthstone-cooldown
https://www.azerothcore.org/catalogue.html#/details/413896014
Press "View on Github" on the right of the page.
Press the green "Code" button and then copy the URL to clipboard.
Log into Linux using Putty
#copy and paste the following command to go to your modules directory
cd ~/azerothcore-wotlk/modules/
#use the gitclone link you copied and paste it after typing "git clone" like so
git clone https://github.com/BytesGalore/mod-no-hearthstone-cooldown.git
#recompile your server by entering the following commands
cd ~/azerothcore-wotlk
./acore.sh compiler build
#Note: If this doesn't work, just type the word compile in Linux. If you followed my guide, "compile" is an alias that will recompile your entire acore server, which takes longer but is complete.

Modifying the config
#first copy the conf.dist to a new file and edit that, like so
cp ~/azerothcore-wotlk/env/dist/etc/modules/mod_no_hearthstone_cooldown.conf.dist ~/azerothcore-wotlk/env/dist/etc/modules/mod_no_hearthstone_cooldown.conf
#edit the newly copied file
nano ~/azerothcore-wotlk/env/dist/etc/modules/mod_no_hearthstone_cooldown.conf
#when finished, ctrl+s to save changes then ctrl+x to exit. now you must restart your wow server for changes to take effect
stop
start
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Module: mod-account-mounts
cd ~/azerothcore-wotlk/modules/
git clone https://github.com/azerothcore/mod-account-mounts
#if you wish to share mounts cross-faction, change the following to limitrace = false. Otherwise, just continue with compiling
#nano ~/azerothcore-wotlk/modules/mod-account-mounts/src/mod_account_mount.cpp
cd ~/azerothcore-wotlk/
./acore.sh compiler build
cp ~/azerothcore-wotlk/env/dist/etc/modules/mod_account_mount.conf.dist ~/azerothcore-wotlk/env/dist/etc/modules/mod_account_mount.conf
#modify the config file if necessary
nano ~/azerothcore-wotlk/env/dist/etc/modules/mod_account_mount.conf
#restart server to take effect!
stop
start

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Part 4 - Installing ARAC module - All Races All Classes. Allows for any race to be any class. Human druids, undead hunters, Gnome Paladins.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I do not know how to reverse this installation so if it messes something up, you are on your own!
https://www.azerothcore.org/catalogue.html#/details/236337938

#log into linux server with putty then clone ARAC repository
cd ~/azerothcore-wotlk/modules
git clone https://github.com/heyitsbench/mod-arac.git
cp ~/azerothcore-wotlk/modules/mod-arac/patch-contents/DBFilesContent/* ~/azerothcore-wotlk/env/dist/bin/dbc

sudo mysql -u root
use acore_world
source ~/azerothcore-wotlk/modules/mod-arac/data/sql/db-world/arac.sql;
exit;
Now just compile!
cd ~/azerothcore-wotlk/
./acore.sh compiler build
#restart server for changes to take effect
stop
start

Now download this file in windows and put it in your wow folder/data folder!
https://github.com/heyitsbench/mod-arac/raw/master/Patch-A.MPQ
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Part 5 - Installing Auction House Bot module (AHBOT)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
https://github.com/NathanHandley/mod-ah-bot-plus

#log into linux server with putty then clone ah-bot repository
cd ~/azerothcore-wotlk/modules
git clone https://github.com/NathanHandley/mod-ah-bot-plus

#Now compile!
build

#We must now copy and edit the ahbot config file.
cp ~/azerothcore-wotlk/env/dist/etc/modules/mod_ahbot.conf.dist ~/azerothcore-wotlk/env/dist/etc/modules/mod_ahbot.conf

#Now you need to make an account and then a character who will be the one posting the auctions. This will be the name of the seller that you see on the AH in game. You can name any of these any name you want.
start
wow
account create ahbot password

Log into this account in-game then create your ahbot character. This will be the name that appears as the seller name on the AH. This char is strictly for AH - don't log into it after this. Addons selected don't matter.
Log out.

#We must now get the GUID of the ahbot character we made. This can most easily be done in the azerothcore terminal or in-game:
wow
lookup player account ahbot
#or if you are in-game
.lookup player account ahbot
It should return something like this:
AC> Characters at account AHBOT (Id: 204)
  Ahbot (GUID 2018) - Orc - Warlock - 1

So your GUID in this case would be 2018. Type your GUID for the ahbot character in the config below.

#use this line from now on to adjust this module's settings! You MUST edit this file because everything is disabled by default in it!!
#If you used my aliases above, you can just type ah to get into the config
ah
nano ~/azerothcore-wotlk/env/dist/etc/modules/mod_ahbot.conf

#the settings I use. Make sure to change the AH bot account number and the character GUID below to yours. Everyones will be different. You can find this information in the HeidiSQL step above.
AuctionHouseBot.DEBUG = false
AuctionHouseBot.DEBUG_FILTERS = false
AuctionHouseBot.AuctionHouseManagerCyclesBetweenBuyOrSell = 1
AuctionHouseBot.EnableSeller = true
AuctionHouseBot.GUIDs = 2018
AuctionHouseBot.ItemsPerCycle = 575

AuctionHouseBot.Alliance.MinItems = 15000
AuctionHouseBot.Alliance.MaxItems = 35000
AuctionHouseBot.Horde.MinItems = 15000
AuctionHouseBot.Horde.MaxItems = 35000
AuctionHouseBot.Neutral.MinItems = 15000
AuctionHouseBot.Neutral.MaxItems = 35000

The config file is pretty large, so feel free to go through it and adjust it based on your preferences!

#Make sure your ahbot config has these settings. I use "ah" to easily get in my ahbot config, set with the aliases earlier in this guide.
ah

#LINK ALL 3 AUCTION HOUSES [Optional but advised]
#You can link all 3 auction houses (Alliance, Horde, and Neutral) by changing the following setting to 1 in your worldserver config file. I currently do this.
world
AllowTwoSide.Interaction.Auction = 1

Reset your server an the AH should be populated!
stop
start
END OF GUIDE!

#delete all auctions from AH database (just in case you want a total refresh or if you want to delete your ah bot account and all the auctions)
mysql -u root
USE acore_characters
DELETE FROM auctionhouse;

alias tm='nano ~/azerothcore-wotlk/env/dist/etc/modules/transmog.conf'

source ~/.bashrc

tm

#IMPORTANT NOTES
-You can't transmog it if you haven't equipped it at least once, even if it's soulbound.
-By default, it charges gold to transmog, but you can disable it in your config file.
-I currently do not know how to get the .transmog portable command working. This command supposedly summons the transmog NPC to any character temporarily in the game, and nobody else can see it.
Supposedly, you have to "pay" for a subscription on ChromieCraft to get this to work? I don't currently know. If anyone knows, speak up!
-You can transmog legendary items.
-I do not currently know how to uninstall this module, so use at your own risk!!

#SETTINGS I LIKE. CHANGE TO YOUR PREFERENCE.
Transmogrification.UseVendorInterface = 1
Transmogrification.ScaledCostModifier = 0

Type this in-game to add the NPC anywhere you want. You must be a GM to do this.
.npc add 190010

You can add transmog sets to players if you're a GM by using similar commands below. Get item sets from wowhead.com or somewhere.
#giantstalker
.transmog add set Painbow 206
#cryptstalker
.transmog add set Painbow 530
#demonstalker
.transmog add set Painbow 651
#riftstalker
.transmog add set Painbow 652

If you want to delete the transmog NPC, target him and type the following:
.npc del


End of transmog guide!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Some notes worth knowing. I learned these from my own experience or talking to devs on discord:
Playerbots ignore PvE rules, so for now it's easiest to stick to a pvp server. (the bots can attack you but you can't attack back in pve. Change to a pvp server in worldserver.conf)
"You don't need to mess around with threads except mapupdate" --Revision
Bot limit seems to vary for unknown reasons. Some people have issues with 500 bots, others can seem to handle 4000. Personally, I don't go above 1200 bots or I start to have issues. Performance improvements are always changing.
Azerothcore devs have stated that they will stop supporting mariadb sometime in the future, so I will recommend using the mysql install with azerothcore.

2025-08-02
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHANGING BEHAVIOR OF YOUR BOTS INDIVIDUALLY OR AS A GROUP WITH STRATEGIES
(Such as stopping your healer from wasting mana on DPS and focusing 100% on healing only!)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here are a few manual commands you can type using the in-game chat (whisper, party, raid chat etc) to command bots.
NOTE: If you re-initialize a bot, the strategies will reset to the default you have in your playerbots.conf file!

If you want your healer bot to ONLY heal you and not dps at all, you will have to adjusts its strategies. You can google playerbot strategies because there are so many, but here is a simple way to do it:
#list and change strategies of a bot or bots. co = combat strategies. nc = non-combat strategies.
co ?
nc ?
#telling healer to stop dpsing and just heal
nc -dps assist
nc ?
You should no longer see the "dps assist" in the bot's nc strategies now.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EASY WAY TO BACKUP AND RESTORE SINGLE CHARACTERS USING GM COMMANDS
(This works in the server window and in-game)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Backing up and restoring a single character with a single file. You can type .pdump while in-game and just pdump if using the azerothcore console in Linux.
#.pdump write $filename $playerNameOrGUID
#.pdump load $filename $account [$newname] [$newguid]

Note 1: The file name you save it as doesn't matter. No matter what the file name you give it, it will restore the character's original character name.
So if you save a character named Painbow two times, one named Painbow44 and another named Painbow45, restoring it will still give you a character named just Painbow.
Note 2: All character saves will be stored here: ~/azerothcore-wotlk/env/dist/bin/

#Make a backup of a character

#to save a backup copy of your character named Painbow using the console.
pdump write Painbow44 Painbow

#to save a backup copy of your character named nirv by typing in-game
.pdump write nirv nirv

#Restore a backed up character. It may be best to delete your current character from the character select screen in WoW or it will make a duplicate character and flag him for a rename

#this will restore character file Painbow44 to the account named "nirv" from the console
pdump load Painbow44 nirv

#this will restore character file Painbow44 to the account named "nirvgorilla" from in-game
.pdump load Painbow44 nirvgorilla
